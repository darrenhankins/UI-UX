### Human Computer Interaction
Chapter 1,2

#### HCI involves the design, implementation and evaluation of interactive systems in the context of the user’s task and work.


* `Interaction` we mean any `communication between a user and computer`, be it direct or indirect.

* This outlines the three major issues of concern: `the people`, `the computers` and the `tasks that are performed`. The system must support the user’s task, which gives us a fourth focus, `usability`: if the system forces the user to adopt an unacceptable mode of work then it is not usable


1. `useful` – accomplish what is required: play music, cook dinner, format a document;
2. `usable` – do it easily and naturally, without danger of error, etc.;
3. `used` – make people want to use it, be attractive, engaging, fun, etc.


* HCI is required to be both a craft and a science in order to be successful.

`Law of size constancy` indicates that our perception of size relies on factors other than the visual angle


Factors
* our `perception of depth`
* `size and height` of the object in our field of view provides a cue to its distance
* `familiarity`: if we expect an object to be of a certain size then we can judge its distance accordingly

We tend to see the center of a page as being a little above the actual center – so if a page is arranged symmetrically around the actual center, we will see it as too low down. In graphic design this is known as the optical center

* Information I/O `- Visual, Aubitory, Haptic, Movment`

* Information Stored in Memory `- Sensory, Short-Term, Long-Term`

* Information Processed and Applied `- Reasoning, Problem Solving, Skill, Error`

### Memory
##### Three types of memory or memory function:
* `Sensory` Memory
  * `ionic` memory (`sight`)
  * `echoic` memory (`audio`)
  * `haptic` memory (`touch`)
* `Short-Term` Memory or `Working Memory` (attention)
  * scratch-pad
  * Continuouly Overwritten
  * `Chunking information` can increase the short-term memory capacity
  * The successful formation of a `chunk` is known as `closure`
  * `7+-2`
* `Long-Term` Memory (rehersal)

`Recency effect` - recall of the last words presented is better than recall of those in the middle

##### Long-Term Memory Structure
* `Episodic memory` represents our memory of events and experiences in a serial form
* `Semantic memory` is a structured record of facts, concepts and skills that we have acquired
* `Semantic network` is items that are associated to each other in classes, and may inherit attributes from parent classes

---
#### Reasoning
* `Deduction` - top down solution
  * Point first, follow up with evidence
* `Induction` - bottom up solution
  * Start with facts, finish with Point
* `Abduction` - reasons from a fact to the action or state that caused it

* ##### Emotion
  * Our emotional response to situations affects how we perform
  * A problem that may be easy to solve when we are relaxed, will become difficult if we are frustrated or afraid
  * So what are the implications of this for design?
    * It suggests that in situations of stress, people will be less able to cope with complex problem solving or managing difficult interfaces, whereas if people are relaxed they will be more forgiving of limitations in the design

#### Iteratory Process - Plan on Change

"You Cant Eat an Elephane All At Once,.. Small Bites"

"Extract Information => Time is Money, So Narrow Down the `What`"

"Think Time, Think, Money => It's Always an `Interview`"

#### `Scope`, `Quality`, `Time/Cost` => Project Management
  * "SQuaT"

  * "Scope creep => When You Diverge/Tangent Out of Scope"

---

##### Project

* How Does It Work?
  * Make It Personal (`You`)
  * "`You will` be able to doe this!"
  * Speak to one person
  * Condense
  * Don't talk yourself out of a connection
  * Connect and move on (don't tangent)

* ###### The Pitch
Speak to 4 ( HR - Director - 2 others)
  * Have `notebook` and `paper`
  * Write name and position under horizontally (know who everyone is)
  * Ask them if they have a question "Help me understand...?"
  * "I don't know, but I really like the question. I'd like to `ponder`/`comeback` to that question."
  * "Help me understand what you mean?"
  * "What's right about it?"
    * "I'm gonna make you blieve in it"
    * Assertive
    * Two way Interview
    * Sell and represent yourself

#### Interactive Design Basics (Ch 10)

  * Design `intervene` as opposed to `improve`
  * Design Process (what happens)
  * Users
  * Scenarios (stories of the design)
  * Navigation
  * Iteration and Prototypes
    * be careful of unrealistic expectations based on prototypes
    * usually don't show a lot until sign contracts
  * When speaking with client
    * What do you want?
      * I can solve this...

`Design` || Goals => Purpose || Constraints || Trade-offs

`Golden Rules` => Understand Materials || Computers || People || Their Interaction

`Process of Design`
  * What is wanted?
    * Analysis
    * Design
      * Protoype => Analysis
    * Implement/Deploy

#### User Focus

    come back to this >

  * 4 Golden Rules
      1. Where you are? (bread crumbs)
      2. What you can do?
      3. Where you're going?
      4. What you've done?


  * Basic Principles
    * Ask
    * Think
    * Design

#### Javascript (Lesson 6)

###### Understanding JavaScript and Coding Essentials

* JavaScript provides action in applicacations
* On client side, Interactivity
* Dynamic application
* Expands opportunity to animate content

Alert Boxes
* Test operation of JS programs
* Generally not used in production code
* Ensures information is displayed to the user
* User has to click OK to close box

JS Statements
* Sequence of statements
* Statements seperated by semi-colons

Functions
* Segment of a program defined and performed in isolation from other parts
* A function returns a value
* Should do 1 thing and 1 thing only and does it well, and well tested
* Subroutines are functions that return no value
* Expression doesn't perform any code withi the the function
* Source code is only definition of function
* When function is executed something useful happens
* Code can be in the head or seperate file
```bash
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/filename.js">
```
* `Centralized Management` - Code in one place
