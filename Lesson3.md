### An Object-Oriented Approach to Programming Logic and Design
#### Programming Logic and Design
###### Lesson 3
###### Understanding General Software Development

###### `ALM` - Application Lifecycle Management
` Is the set of activities that evolve around a new software product, from its inception to when the product matures`

- Understanding Testing
- Understanding Data Structures
- Understanding Sorting Algorithms

###### ALM Planning and Designing
- Requirements - Document
- Design - Flow Chart (pseudo code - structured)
- Development - Coding
- Testing (divide and conquer approach to finding a bug)
- Maintenance (return to the ALM planning)

Structured and Un-structured flowcharts - need structured code for correct coding

`NOTE: You don't pick the technology until after the design. The design dictates the technology. Don't let the technology drive your project`

###### Requirements
- Analysis is the process of determining the `detailed` business requirements for a new software system
- A business analyst is responsible for analyzing business needs and converting them into `requirements` (creating functions) that can be executed by the development team

###### Design
- Activity is used to crate plans models, and architecture for how the software will be implemented
- Participants
 - Architecture

###### Development
- The software development activity involves implementing design by creating software code, databases, and other related content.
  - Participants
    - Developers
    - Database admin DBA's
    - Technical writers
    - Content developers

###### Testing
- Testing is used to assure the quality of the final product
- Identifies possible gaps between the system expectations and described in the requirements documents and actual system behavior (testing against your requirements document)
- Participants
  - Testers

###### Understanding Testing
- Software testing is the process of verifying software against its requirements
- Software testing can only help find defects - it cannot guarantee the absence of defects
- It is much more cost-effective to find defects earlier (rather than later) in the product development cycle

###### Testing Methods
- `Black-box Testing`
  - Focusing solely on inputs and outputs
  - any knowledge of intersystem workings is not used for testing
  - Is used to make sure a software application covers all its requirements
- `White-box testing`
  - Testers use their knowledge of system internals when testing the system
  - Is used to make sure that each method or function has proper test cases available

###### Testing levels
- `Unit Testing`
  - Verifies the functionality of a unit of
- `Integration Testing`
  - Assesses the interface between software components
- `System Testing`
  - Overall testing of the software system
- `Acceptance Testing`
    - Makes sure the client is aware and involved
- `Regression Testing`
  - Makes sure that each new fix doesn't break anything that was previously working

###### Understanding Data Structures
- Data structures are techniques for organizing and storing data in computer memory
- Understanding a data structure involves
  - Understanding the storage patter
  - Understanding what methods are used to create, access, and manipulate the data structures
- Common data structures
  - Arrays
  - Ques

###### Arrays
- collection of items of the same type
- stored in contiguous memory locations
- capacity of an array is predefined and fixed
- any array item can be directly accessed by using an index
- arrays are zero based

###### Arrays - Internal Representation
- Stack is located in RAM
- Heap is located on drive

###### Arrays - Common Operations
- Arrays support the following Operations
  - Allocation
  - access
